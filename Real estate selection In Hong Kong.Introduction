Greetings! I am from Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is renowned of its high housing price, for various years, the housing price in Hong Kong is the highest in the planet earth! Therefore, as a local, if I have to purchase a house, I have to be extremely careful, and to select a house not only that it fits my need, but also to select one that it's affordable, and ofcouse, as low the price as possible and the house must be surrounded by shops, facilities, restaurants that I like the most!
