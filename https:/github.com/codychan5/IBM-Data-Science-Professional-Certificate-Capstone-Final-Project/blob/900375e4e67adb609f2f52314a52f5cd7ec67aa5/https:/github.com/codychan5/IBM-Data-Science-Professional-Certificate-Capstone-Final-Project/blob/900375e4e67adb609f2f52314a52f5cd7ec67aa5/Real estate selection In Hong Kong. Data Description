As for the data needed for my housing selection, I would need to have the geospatial data of Hong Kong, which I would be using folium and as well as Foursquare to attain them. Meanwhile, I would also need to gain the average housing price of each "cluster" / "neighbourhood" so as to select the house that surrounds with the the amenities that I like and at the same time with the best price!
